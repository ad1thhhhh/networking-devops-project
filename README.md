#  Barista Task List App – Full Cloud Automation on Azure

##  DevOps Automation Project

This project demonstrates a **Fully automated DevOps architecture** for deploying the **Barista Task List App** to **Microsoft Azure** using:

- Infrastructure as Code (**Terraform**)
- Containerization (**Docker**)
- CI/CD Automation (**GitHub Actions**)
- Configuration Management (**Ansible**)
- Immutable Infrastructure Principles

The system uses **two independent CI/CD pipelines**:

1. **Infrastructure Pipeline** – Provisions and manages Azure infrastructure  
2. **Application Deployment Pipeline** – Builds and deploys the containerized application  

This separation ensures production-level release safety, lifecycle control, and reduced operational risk.

---

#  High-Level Architecture

The architecture follows **immutable infrastructure principles**:

- Infrastructure is defined declaratively
- No manual server configuration
- Containers are replaced, not modified
- Infrastructure and application lifecycles are decoupled

---

#  Cloud Infrastructure – Microsoft Azure

All infrastructure is provisioned using Terraform.

## Provisioned Resources

- Azure Resource Group  
- Virtual Network (VNet)  
- Subnet  
- Network Security Group  
- Public IP Address  
- Linux Virtual Machine   

## VM Bootstrapping

During provisioning, the VM:

- Installs Docker Engine automatically
- Configures required dependencies
- Prepares runtime environment
- Runs containerized application on port:

```
80 → 5000
```

Infrastructure is fully manageable using:

```bash
terraform apply
terraform destroy
```

---

#  CI/CD Pipeline Architecture

The system is designed with **clear separation of concerns**:

| Pipeline | Responsibility |
|-----------|----------------|
| Infrastructure Pipeline | Provision & manage Azure resources |
| Application Pipeline | Build & deploy containerized app |

---

#  1. Infrastructure Pipeline

##  i) Trigger

- Triggered on changes in `/terraform` directory
- Push to `main` branch

##  ii) Workflow Responsibilities

- Checkout repository
- Authenticate to Azure using Service Principal
- Setup Terraform dynamically
- Run `terraform init`
- Run `terraform plan`
- Run `terraform apply -auto-approve`
- Extract VM public IP using `terraform output`
- Update GitHub repository secret (`VM_IP`) dynamically
- Enable cross-pipeline communication securely

                     ▼
           Infrastructure Ready
```

##  iv) Key Engineering Capabilities

- Idempotent infrastructure provisioning
- Secure Azure authentication via `azure/login@v2`
- Dynamic Terraform environment setup
- Runtime extraction of infrastructure outputs
- Automated secret propagation using GitHub CLI
- Zero manual cloud configuration

#  2. Application Deployment Pipeline

##  i) Trigger

- Push to:
  - `/app/**`
  - `/ansible/**`
- Manual trigger via `workflow_dispatch`

##  ii) Workflow Responsibilities

- Checkout application code
- Authenticate to DockerHub
- Build Docker image from `/app`
- Tag image using commit SHA
- Push image to DockerHub
- SSH into Azure VM
- Pull latest container image
- Stop existing container (if running)
- Remove old container instance
- Deploy new container
- Expose application on port `80 → 5000`
